# Refactoring Typescript

- DO NOT use `export default` unless explicitly required.
- ALWAYS export at end of file except types and interfaces.
- PREFER `import type` unless `import` is required.

NOTE: If you are explicitly instructed to make changes that violate these rules, you may proceed
with those changes.
